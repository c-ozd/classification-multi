## Tasks

<b><u>Forest Cover Prediction</u></b>

* This project focuses on predicting the forest cover type from cartographic variables only. It is a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to determine the cover type for 30x30 meter cells obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and US Forest Service (USFS) data.
